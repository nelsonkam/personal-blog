Hello [Chema Rubio](https://medium.com/@develodroid) ,

I’ve for long being a Dart fan. I love how productive you can get with it in web development. When I heard about Flutter I was amazed that all these advantages and goodies would be available for mobile development. Your article is a great one and illustrates well the beauty behind Flutter.

However, I noticed that UI components (widgets) are created using classes and named parameters and this could get very messy with complex UIs that need several widgets. My opinion is that this could lead to files with very long and ugly class instantiations. I would like to know if there are plans to implement solutions for this issue (It could be a separate UI markup language as with XML in traditional Android development).

Looking forward to your reply.
