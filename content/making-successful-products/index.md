Making a product is all about craftsmanship. Making a successful product implies that you start showing it off way before launch. You should create anticipation for your product. You should build your audience while making your product; discuss with those who have the problem your product is trying to solve. They should know that you’re working something that will make their life better, that will solve a pain they have. Give early access to some users especially those who feel their problem needs an immediate solution. Make your product so good that they and all subsequent users can’t complain and can only praise your product. Show the hard work and only deliver premium experience. Overdeliver. Always give more. Your customers should be proud to say they are your customers. Show them your vision and your mission. Give them something to stand for. Let your product mean something to them. Talk with them always. Keep them updated. Make announcements and launch new versions of your product like it was the first time. Always keep your customers amazed and mesmerized. Make it feel like magic. Use technology and all you have to make the experience slick.
