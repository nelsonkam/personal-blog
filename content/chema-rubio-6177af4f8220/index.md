Thanks for your reply. I really appreciate the idea of using “little widgets” to encapsulate unique functionality as this ensures code reusability, modularity and testability. You also mentioned some implementations of this idea (React and Anko). I would like to add that these implementations rely on DSLs (for example, JSX in React) to make the whole process way more lightweight. I believe a similar idea would be welcome for Flutter.
